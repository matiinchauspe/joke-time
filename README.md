A modern web application for managing and rating jokes built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Radix UI components using shadcn.

## Features

- Sort jokes by different criteria (newest, rating, votes)
- Modern UI components using Radix UI primitives
- Fully typed with TypeScript

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (I use `pnpm`)
3. Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL`: The URL of the application (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) - See the .env.example
4. Run the development server: `pnpm dev`
